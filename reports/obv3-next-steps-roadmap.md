- *Mitigation*: Dedicated 2-week sprint, external testing consultant
- *Fallback*: Extend timeline by 2 weeks if coverage <90%

**OAuth Security Implementation** (Week 3-4)
- *Risk*: Security vulnerabilities in production
- *Mitigation*: Security expert review, penetration testing
- *Fallback*: API key authentication for initial deployment

### ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM RISK
**1EdTech Conformance Integration** (Week 9)
- *Risk*: Certification requirements may change
- *Mitigation*: Early engagement with 1EdTech, continuous monitoring
- *Fallback*: Manual conformance testing if harness unavailable

**Performance Under Load** (Week 13)
- *Risk*: System may not handle production traffic
- *Mitigation*: Stress testing, performance monitoring

- **Phase 3**: 4 weeks (Hardening & docs)
- **Total**: 16 weeks (4 months)

### Budget Considerations
- Testing infrastructure and tools
- Security audit and penetration testing
- 1EdTech certification fees
- Documentation and SDK development
- Production hosting and monitoring

---

## Next Immediate Actions

### Week 1 Sprint Planning (URGENT)
1. **Assign test coverage lead developer**
2. **Set up dedicated testing environment**
3. **Create comprehensive test plan**
4. **Establish coverage metrics and reporting**
5. **Begin unit test development immediately**

### Critical Dependencies
- Test coverage must reach 90% before any feature development
- OAuth security must be complete before production deployment
- 1EdTech conformance must pass before certification submission

---

## Conclusion

This roadmap prioritizes **CRITICAL TEST COVERAGE** as the immediate blocker, followed by security implementation and compliance certification. The 16-week timeline provides a realistic path to full OBv3 compliance with proper testing, security, and documentation.

**Success depends on**:
1. **Immediate action on test coverage** - No other work until testing is complete
2. **Security-first approach** - OAuth implementation cannot be compromised
3. **1EdTech certification** - Official compliance validation required
4. **Production readiness** - Hardening and documentation for real-world deployment

The project has strong foundations but requires disciplined execution of this roadmap to achieve full OBv3 compliance and production readiness.
