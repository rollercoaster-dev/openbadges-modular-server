- **refactor-code.prompt.md** - Code refactoring following established patterns

### 3. Documentation
- **File**: `.github/COPILOT_CONFIGURATION.md`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive guide explaining the configuration and usage
- **Content**: Setup instructions, best practices, troubleshooting, maintenance

### 4. README Integration
- **Updated**: `README.md`
- **Added**: GitHub Copilot Configuration section with features and usage instructions

## Key Features Implemented

### Code Quality & Standards
âœ… Enforce strict TypeScript usage with explicit return types and no 'any' types
âœ… Require the use of the project's logger service instead of console.log statements
âœ… Mandate absolute imports using '@/' path aliases for better organization
âœ… Ensure proper error handling patterns with centralized helper functions

### Database & Architecture
âœ… Promote Drizzle ORM patterns and type-safe database operations
âœ… Enforce proper transaction usage with Drizzle's transaction helper
âœ… Require repository pattern usage through RepositoryFactory
âœ… Mandate proper resource cleanup and connection management

### Security & Compliance
âœ… Enforce Open Badges 3.0 specification compliance requirements
âœ… Require proper validation for DID/IRI formats in recipientId fields
âœ… Mandate crypto.randomUUID() instead of Math.random() for unique identifiers
âœ… Enforce sanitization of sensitive data in logging

### Testing & Development
âœ… Promote database-agnostic E2E testing patterns
âœ… Enforce proper test isolation and cleanup
âœ… Require specific status code expectations in authentication tests
âœ… Mandate use of Bun runtime commands instead of npm

### Package Management
âœ… Enforce use of Bun package manager commands
âœ… Prevent manual editing of package.json for dependency management

## Integration with Existing Tools

### ESLint Compatibility
- Complements existing ESLint rules with architectural guidance
- Provides context-aware suggestions beyond static analysis
- Maintains consistency with established linting standards

### CI/CD Integration
- Aligns with GitHub Actions workflows using Bun runtime
- Supports multi-database testing patterns (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
- Maintains compatibility with existing build and deployment processes

### Development Workflow
- Integrates with Husky pre-commit and pre-push hooks
- Supports semantic-release version management
- Aligns with Docker multi-architecture build processes

## Usage Instructions

### Automatic Application
