# CI/CD Workflow Troubleshooting Session

**Date**: 2025-06-09  
**Time**: 14:59 - 15:06 UTC  
**Session ID**: ci-cd-troubleshooting-2025-06-09-15-06  
**Repository**: rollercoaster-dev/openbadges-modular-server  
**Branch**: beta  

## Session Overview

### Objective
Update the CI/CD setup on the beta branch by pulling improved workflows from the main branch to resolve ongoing release workflow failures.

### Context
- User reported CI setup failures and requested to "check the actions on main and pull them over here"
- Multiple previous release workflow failures on beta branch (runs #21-27 all failed)
- Need to establish reliable Docker release pipeline to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)

## Changes Made

### 1. Workflow Files Modified

#### `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- **Initial Change**: Updated from main branch approach
  - Changed trigger from `workflow_run` to `push` (commit: 4509baa)
  - Simplified release logic using proven main branch approach
  - Added retry logic with conflict resolution
  - Removed complex GitHub CLI installation and debugging steps

- **Correction Applied**: Reverted to `workflow_run` dependency
  - Changed back from `push` to `workflow_run` trigger
  - Added `if: github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success'` condition
  - Updated checkout to use `${{ github.event.workflow_run.head_sha }}`
  - Fixed git fetch to use `${{ github.event.workflow_run.head_branch }}`

#### `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Applied cleaner formatting and structure from main branch
- Maintained support for both main and beta branches
- Preserved all existing functionality (SQLite + PostgreSQL testing)

### 2. Key Configuration Details

#### Semantic Release Configuration (`.releaserc.json`)
```json
{
  "branches": [
    "main",
    {"name": "beta", "prerelease": true},
    {"name": "alpha", "prerelease": true}
  ],
  "plugins": [
    "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
    "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator", 
    "@semantic-release/changelog",
    "@semantic-release/git",
    "@semantic-release/github"
  ]
}
```x

#### Docker Release Flow
```
Push to beta → CI Tests → Release Workflow → Docker Build & Push
     ↓             ↓              ↓                    ↓
  Triggers CI   Tests Pass   Creates GitHub      Builds & pushes
   workflow     (required)    release + tag      multi-arch images
                                                 to GitHub Container
                                                      Registry
```

## Problems Identified

### 1. **Critical Race Condition** ⚠️
- **Issue**: Release workflow running simultaneously with CI instead of after CI completion
- **Evidence**: Both workflows triggered at 15:02:56Z for commit 4509baa
- **Impact**: Potential for releasing untested code
- **Root Cause**: Used `push` trigger instead of `workflow_run` dependency

### 2. **Missing GitHub CLI Installation**
- **Issue**: Release workflow uses `gh` commands but doesn't install GitHub CLI
- **Evidence**: Verification step uses `gh release view` command
- **Impact**: Verification step likely fails

### 3. **Beta Branch Release Configuration**
- **Issue**: No existing beta releases, only main branch releases (v1.0.1-v1.0.9)
- **Evidence**: All releases are standard versions, no prerelease versions found
- **Impact**: Semantic-release may not know how to handle first beta release

### 4. **Semantic Release Execution Issues**
- **Issue**: "Release with retry logic" step failed after 2+ minutes
- **Evidence**: Step ran from 15:03:06Z to 15:05:35Z and failed
- **Potential Causes**:
  - Missing GitHub CLI for verification
  - Git conflicts during release process
  - Semantic-release unable to determine version increment

## Current Status

### Workflow Execution Results

#### CI Workflow (Run #305)
- **Status**: ✅ SUCCESS
- **Run ID**: 15537698742
- **Duration**: ~1 minute (15:02:56Z - 15:04:07Z)
- **Commit**: 4509baa39fbbd978d655b88cb4ec2d7c5091090e
- **Tests**: Both SQLite and PostgreSQL tests passed

#### Release Workflow (Run #28)
- **Status**: ❌ FAILURE  
- **Run ID**: 15537698721
- **Duration**: ~2.5 minutes (15:02:56Z - 15:05:37Z)
- **Commit**: 4509baa39fbbd978d655b88cb4ec2d7c5091090e
- **Failed Step**: "Release with retry logic" (step #9)
- **Subsequent Steps**: Skipped due to failure

### Git State
- **Current Branch**: beta
- **Latest Commit**: 4509baa39fbbd978d655b88cb4ec2d7c5091090e
- **Commit Message**: "fix(ci): update release workflow with improved approach from main branch"
- **Package Version**: 1.0.10-beta.1 (from package.json)

## Technical Details

### Commit History (Recent)
1. **4509baa** (2025-06-09 15:02:10Z) - fix(ci): update release workflow with improved approach from main branch
2. **5c76227** (2025-06-09 14:58:17Z) - docs: update release documentation to include beta branch support  
3. **2375d5c** (2025-06-09 14:37:26Z) - fix(ci): ensure release workflow checks out correct commit

### Workflow Run Analysis
- **Total Beta Workflow Runs**: 14 (as of session end)
- **Recent Failures**: Runs #21-28 (all release workflow failures)
- **Last Successful Release**: None on beta branch
- **Main Branch Releases**: v1.0.1 through v1.0.9 (all successful)

### Error Patterns Observed
1. **Semantic-release timeouts**: Multiple 2+ minute execution times
2. **Git operation conflicts**: Previous attempts with git reset/fetch issues
3. **Missing dependencies**: GitHub CLI not available for verification
4. **Branch context confusion**: workflow_run vs push trigger context mismatches

## Next Steps Required

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix Workflow Dependency**: Commit the corrected release.yml with workflow_run trigger
2. **Add GitHub CLI Installation**: Include GitHub CLI setup in release workflow
3. **Test Beta Release**: Trigger a test release to establish beta versioning baseline

### Validation Steps
1. Verify CI completes before release workflow starts
2. Confirm semantic-release can create first beta release (v1.0.10-beta.1)
3. Validate Docker workflow triggers after successful release
4. Test end-to-end flow: commit → CI → release → Docker build

### Monitoring Points
- Workflow execution order and timing
- Semantic-release version calculation for beta branch
- Docker image build and push to GHCR
- Release notes and changelog generation

## Detailed Workflow Analysis

### Release Workflow Job Breakdown (Run #15537698721)
```
✅ Set up job (15:03:00Z - 15:03:01Z)
✅ Checkout (15:03:01Z - 15:03:02Z)
✅ Setup Bun (15:03:02Z - 15:03:04Z)
✅ Install dependencies (15:03:04Z - 15:03:05Z)
✅ Build application (15:03:05Z - 15:03:05Z)
✅ Configure Git (15:03:05Z - 15:03:06Z)
✅ Check for existing release (15:03:06Z - 15:03:06Z)
✅ Setup semantic-release (15:03:06Z - 15:03:06Z)
❌ Release with retry logic (15:03:06Z - 15:05:35Z) - FAILED
⏭️ Verify release - SKIPPED
```

### Docker Release Configuration
- **Registry**: GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)
- **Image Name**: ghcr.io/rollercoaster-dev/openbadges-modular-server
- **Architecture**: Multi-arch (ARM64 + AMD64)
- **Trigger**: Release event from semantic-release
- **NPM Token**: dummy (Docker-only release, no NPM publishing)

### Semantic Release Behavior Analysis
- **Expected Beta Version**: v1.0.10-beta.1 (based on package.json)
- **Commit Type**: fix(ci) - should trigger patch release
- **Branch Config**: beta branch configured for prerelease
- **Missing**: No previous beta releases to base version on

## Session Outcome

**Status**: Partially Resolved
**Key Achievement**: Identified and diagnosed the race condition issue
**Pending**: Implementation of workflow dependency fix and testing
**Risk Level**: Medium (release workflow still failing, but CI is stable)

### Recommended Fix Implementation
1. Commit the workflow_run dependency fix
2. Add GitHub CLI installation step
3. Test with a small functional change (not docs-only)
4. Monitor for successful beta release creation
