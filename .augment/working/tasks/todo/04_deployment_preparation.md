# Task: Deployment Preparation

## Priority
High - Estimated effort: 2 days

## Background
While the application has Docker configuration files, the deployment process is not fully documented or tested. Preparing for deployment involves finalizing Docker configurations, creating comprehensive deployment documentation, and implementing health checks and monitoring. This task is essential for ensuring a smooth transition to production.

## Objectives
- Finalize Docker container configuration
- Create comprehensive deployment documentation
- Implement health checks and monitoring
- Prepare CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Implement semantic versioning strategy
- Define complete release process

## Implementation Details
The deployment preparation involves finalizing the Docker configuration, creating comprehensive documentation, and implementing health checks and monitoring. The implementation should ensure that the application can be easily deployed to production environments.

### Technical Approach
1. Review and finalize the Docker configuration
2. Create comprehensive deployment documentation
3. Implement health checks for all critical components
4. Configure logging for production environments
5. Prepare CI/CD pipeline configuration
6. Implement semantic versioning
7. Define and document release process

## Current Infrastructure Assessment

### Docker Configuration
- **Strengths**:
  - Multi-stage build process reduces image size
  - Separate services for API, database, migrations, and backups
  - Health check scripts implemented
  - Production-specific Docker Compose configuration
- **Areas for Improvement**:
  - Resource limits need optimization
  - Logging configuration needs enhancement
  - Security settings should be reviewed

### Database Management
- **Strengths**:
  - Support for both SQLite and PostgreSQL
  - Migration scripts for both database types
  - Automated backup service with retention policy
  - Restore procedures documented
- **Areas for Improvement**:
  - High availability configuration missing
  - Database scaling strategy not defined
  - Recovery testing procedures not documented

### Monitoring and Health Checks
- **Strengths**:
  - Basic health check service implemented
  - Docker container health checks configured
  - Database connection monitoring
- **Areas for Improvement**:
  - Limited metrics collection
  - No integration with external monitoring systems
  - Alerting not configured

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Strengths**:
  - Tests for both SQLite and PostgreSQL
  - Coverage reporting configured
  - Draft workflows for improvements exist
- **Areas for Improvement**:
  - No deployment stages for different environments
  - Versioning strategy not implemented
  - Release process not automated

## Semantic Versioning Implementation

### Version Numbering Guidelines
1. **Format**: Follow `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format (e.g., `1.0.0`)
   - **MAJOR**: Increment for incompatible API changes
   - **MINOR**: Increment for backward-compatible functionality additions
   - **PATCH**: Increment for backward-compatible bug fixes

2. **Pre-release Versions**:
   - Use `-alpha.N`, `-beta.N`, `-rc.N` suffixes (e.g., `1.0.0-beta.1`)
   - Alpha: Early testing, expect bugs
   - Beta: Feature complete, testing for bugs
   - RC (Release Candidate): Potential release version

3. **Version Exposure**:
   - Add version information to API responses
   - Create a `/version` endpoint
   - Include version in logs and health checks

### Implementation Steps
1. Create a version management module in `src/utils/version/`
   - Implement version parsing and comparison
   - Read version from package.json
   - Expose version through API

2. Update build process to include version information
   - Inject version during build time
   - Include git commit hash for debugging

3. Create version bump scripts
   - Add npm scripts for version bumping
   - Automate CHANGELOG updates

### Tagging and Release Documentation
1. **Git Tagging Process**:
   - Tag format: `v1.0.0`
   - Sign tags for security
   - Push tags as part of release process

2. **CHANGELOG Management**:
   - Create `CHANGELOG.md` in project root
   - Follow "Keep a Changelog" format
   - Categories: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security

3. **Release Notes**:
   - Generate from CHANGELOG
   - Include upgrade instructions
   - Document breaking changes prominently

## CI/CD Pipeline Improvements

### Pipeline Stages
1. **Build and Test**:
   - Lint and type check
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests with both database types
   - Coverage reporting

2. **Version Management**:
   - Validate version bump
   - Generate CHANGELOG updates
   - Create release notes

3. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Run smoke tests
   - Deploy to production with approval
   - Tag release in git

### Environment-Specific Configurations
1. **Development**:
   - Use SQLite for simplicity
   - Run in debug mode
   - Enable detailed logging

2. **Staging**:
   - Mirror production configuration
   - Use separate database instances
   - Enable monitoring and alerting

3. **Production**:
   - Use PostgreSQL with high availability
   - Enable performance optimizations
   - Restrict debug information

### Workflow Implementation
1. Update GitHub Actions workflow files:
   - Consolidate draft workflows
   - Add deployment stages
   - Configure environment-specific variables

2. Implement deployment approval process:
   - Manual approval for production deployments
   - Automated rollback on failure
   - Deployment notifications

3. Add release automation:
   - Version bump validation
   - CHANGELOG generation
   - Release notes publication

## Release Process Implementation
