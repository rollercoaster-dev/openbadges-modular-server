## Current Open PR: #61 - Fix/release workflow manual trigger

### üî¥ Critical Issues (Must Fix)

#### 1. Missing Workflow Permissions
**File**: `.github/workflows/release.yml` (lines 18-22)  
**Issue**: Missing required permissions for `packages` and `id-token`  
**Impact**: Pipeline failures  
**Fix Required**:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write
  packages: write      # ADD THIS
  id-token: write      # ADD THIS
```

#### 2. Workflow Configuration Issues
**File**: `.github/workflows/release.yml`  
**Issues**:
- Line 5: `workflow_run` event missing proper branch filtering
- Line 9: `branches` key under `workflow_run` is ignored by Actions
- Line 10: Removed `paths-ignore` causes unnecessary runs
- Line 33: `PAT_TOKEN` usage needs documentation

**Fix Required**: Add conditional branch checks and restore path filtering

### üü° High Priority Issues

#### 3. YAML Linting Errors
**File**: `.github/workflows/release.yml`  
**Issues**:
- Lines 46, 50, 63, 71, 74, 76: Trailing spaces
- Missing newline at end of file

#### 4. Action Version Updates
**File**: `.github/workflows/release.yml` (line 84)  
**Issue**: `softprops/action-gh-release@v1` is outdated  
**Fix**: Update to `@v2`

#### 5. Docker Workflow Issues
**File**: `.github/workflows/docker.yml`  
**Issues**:
- Missing concurrency control for overlapping builds
- Missing newline at end of file (line 52)

### üü° Medium Priority Issues

#### 6. CI Workflow Improvements
**File**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (lines 11-89)  
**Issue**: DRY violation - repeated setup across jobs  
**Suggestion**: Extract into reusable composite action

#### 7. Documentation Updates
**Files**: Multiple documentation files  
**Issues**:
- `docs/commit-convention.md` (line 121): Missing language identifier in code block
- `docs/release-process.md` (line 189): Missing comma
- `docs/release-process-analysis.md`: Multiple grammar and formatting issues
- `README.md` (lines 325-334): Outdated semantic-release references

### üü¢ Low Priority Issues (Nitpicks)

#### 8. Markdown Linting
**Files**: Various `.md` files  
**Issues**:
- Missing language specifiers in fenced code blocks
- Emphasis used instead of headings
- List indentation issues
- Grammar and punctuation improvements

#### 9. GitHub CLI Optimization
**File**: `docs/CI_CD_Analysis_and_Recommendations.md` (lines 43-47)  
**Suggestion**: Use official GitHub CLI Action instead of `apt-get` install

## Notes

- Focus on critical workflow issues first to unblock PR merging
- Some nitpick issues can be addressed in follow-up PRs
- Consider creating separate PRs for documentation fixes vs workflow fixes
- Test all workflow changes in a feature branch before applying to main

## Detailed Review Comments

### CodeRabbit Review Summary
**Total Comments**: 21 (4 actionable, 16 nitpicks, 1 outside diff range)

#### Failed to Post Comments (4)
These are critical suggestions that couldn't be posted due to GitHub limits:

1. **Tag-triggered releases** (`docs/CI_CD_Analysis_and_Recommendations.md`, lines 29-37)
   - Suggestion: Enable tag-triggered releases in workflow
   - Add `tags: - 'v*.*.*'` to workflow triggers

2. **README semantic-release references** (`README.md`, lines 325-334)
   - Issue: Still references semantic-release but workflow uses custom script
   - Need to update release process description

3. **Missing workflow files** (`docs/ci-cd-improvements-summary.md`, lines 31-33)
   - Issue: "Files Modified" section missing key workflow files
   - Need to include `.github/workflows` changes and `.releaserc.json` removal
