# Enhance Test Coverage

> _Intended for: [x] Internal Task  [x] GitHub Issue  [ ] Pull Request_

## 1. Goal & Context
- **Objective:** Significantly increase test coverage across unit, integration, and performance tests to improve code reliability and catch regressions early.
- **Branch:** `feat/improve-test-coverage`
- **Energy Level:** [Medium] ðŸ”‹
- **Focus Strategy:** [Timeboxing, Pair Programming]
- **Status:** [ðŸŸ¡ In Progress]

### Background
The initial code review identified gaps in test coverage. Comprehensive testing is crucial for maintaining the stability and correctness of the Open Badges server, especially given the importance of compliance and data integrity. This task addresses recommendations to add integration tests, performance tests, and increase unit test coverage for utilities. (Ref: `code-review.md`)

## 2. Resources & Dependencies
- **Prerequisites:** [None directly, but requires understanding of project structure and testing framework]
- **Key Files/Tools:**
    - Testing framework (e.g., Vitest, Jest - needs verification)
    - Coverage reporting tools
    - `src/api/**` (for integration tests)
    - `src/core/**` (for integration/unit tests)
    - `src/utils/**` (for unit tests)
    - `src/infrastructure/database/**` (for integration tests)
- **Additional Needs:** [Agreement on testing framework if not standardized, potential test data generation]

## 3. Planning & Steps
### Quick Wins
- [ ] Set up and run initial coverage report to establish baseline (15 min)
- [ ] Add 1-2 simple unit tests for a utility function (30 min)

### Major Steps
1. [Verify/Configure Testing Framework & Environment] (1-2 hours) ðŸŽ¯
2. [Analyze Coverage Report for Gaps] (1 hour) ðŸŽ¯
3. [Write Integration Tests for Core API Endpoints (Issuance, Verification, Well-known)] (4-6 hours) ðŸŽ¯
4. [Increase Unit Test Coverage for `utils` (crypto, validation, jsonld, version)] (3-5 hours) ðŸŽ¯
5. [Investigate & Implement Basic Performance Tests for Critical API Routes] (2-4 hours) ðŸŽ¯

### Testing & Definition of Done
- [ ] Test coverage percentage significantly increased (target TBD, e.g., >80%).
- [ ] New unit and integration tests written for identified gaps.
- [ ] Basic performance benchmarks established for key endpoints.
- [ ] All tests pass in CI environment.

### Current Status (Updated 2025-05-05)

This task is still in progress. Based on a review of the implementation plan and acceptance criteria, here's the current status:

#### Completed:
- Initial project setup and testing framework configuration appears to be in place
- Some basic test files exist in the codebase

#### Remaining (Prioritized):
1. **High Priority:**
   - Set up and run initial coverage report to establish baseline
   - Analyze coverage report to identify critical gaps
   - Add integration tests for core API endpoints (issuance, verification)

2. **Medium Priority:**
   - Increase unit test coverage for utility functions
   - Add tests for database interactions

3. **Lower Priority:**
   - Implement performance tests for critical API routes
   - Set up CI pipeline for automated test execution

#### Next Steps:
1. Run coverage report to establish current baseline
2. Create a prioritized list of specific components needing test coverage
3. Focus on integration tests for core API endpoints first

**Context Resume Point:**
_Last worked on:_ Initial task planning
_Next action:_ Run coverage report and analyze results
_Blockers:_ None identified
