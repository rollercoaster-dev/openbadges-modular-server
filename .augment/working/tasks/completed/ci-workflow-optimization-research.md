# CI Workflow Optimization Research

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours  
**Created**: 2025-01-09  
**Assignee**: Development Team  

## 🎯 Objective

Research and design the optimal CI/CD workflow architecture for the OpenBadges Modular Server project, moving from the current multi-workflow approach to a single, sequential pipeline with proper dependencies.

## 📋 Current State Analysis

### Current Architecture Issues:
- **Separate CI and Release workflows** with no explicit dependencies
- **Parallel test jobs** (SQLite + PostgreSQL) that could be sequential
- **No guarantee** that release runs on tested code
- **Potential race conditions** between workflows
- **Complex workflow management** across multiple files

### Current Workflows:
- `ci.yml` - Runs tests on PR and push to main
- `release.yml` - Builds and releases (no tests)
- `docker-build.yml` - Container builds
- `test-release.yml` - Additional testing

### ✅ **ANALYSIS COMPLETED** - Moving to Full Redesign

**Key Findings:**
- Release workflow failing in semantic-release step
- 4 commits since v1.0.9 need release (including feat: commit)
- Current architecture has race conditions and no quality gates
- Multiple workflow files create maintenance complexity
