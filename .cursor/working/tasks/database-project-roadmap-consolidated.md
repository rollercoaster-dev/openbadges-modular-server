### Medium Risk ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **E2E testing completion**: Requires coordination with existing test infrastructure
- **CI integration**: May require environment configuration adjustments

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Follow established patterns**: Use existing successful refactoring approaches
2. **Incremental testing**: Test each component thoroughly before integration
3. **Rollback capability**: Maintain ability to revert changes if needed

## Timeline Estimate

### Immediate (Next 1-2 weeks)
- **PR Group 1**: PostgreSQL test infrastructure cleanup (0.5 days)
- **PR Group 2**: E2E testing completion (2-3 days)

### Short-term (Following 1-2 weeks)
- **PR Group 3**: Documentation and deployment (1-2 days)

### Total Remaining Effort: 3.5-5.5 days
