# Task: Assertion Signing Enhancement

## Status
COMPLETED

## Priority
High - Estimated effort: 2-3 days

## Background
The verification service has a solid foundation but needs refinement to fully support the OpenBadges 3.0 specification. Currently, the signature verification logic is limited, with support for only one verification method and incomplete error handling. Enhancing the assertion signing and verification process is crucial for ensuring the integrity and authenticity of badges issued through the system.

## Objectives
- Support multiple signature algorithms
- Implement proper OB3 proof verification
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Improve documentation for verification process

## Implementation Details
The assertion signing and verification process needs to be enhanced to support multiple signature algorithms and properly implement the OB3 proof verification. The implementation should follow the OpenBadges 3.0 specification for verifiable credentials.

### Technical Approach
1. Refactor the `VerificationService` to support multiple signature algorithms
2. Implement proper OB3 proof verification following the W3C Verifiable Credentials standard
3. Add comprehensive error handling for verification failures
4. Create a verification status model with detailed information
5. Improve key management to support multiple key types

## Acceptance Criteria
- Multiple signature algorithms are supported (at minimum: RSA, Ed25519)
- OB3 proof verification is properly implemented
- Comprehensive error handling provides clear error messages
- Verification status includes detailed information about the verification process
- Unit and integration tests cover all verification scenarios
- Documentation clearly explains the verification process

- `/src/api/controllers/assertion.controller.ts` - Controller with verification endpoints

## Dependencies
- None, but should be completed before production deployment

## Notes
- Consider implementing a key rotation strategy
- Ensure compatibility with existing badges
- Follow W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model for OB3 verification
- Consider adding support for blockchain-based verification in the future

## Progress
- [x] Refactor `VerificationService` to support multiple signature algorithms
- [x] Implement proper OB3 proof verification
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling
- [x] Create verification status model
- [x] Improve key management
- [x] Write unit and integration tests
- [x] Update documentation

## Current Status (Updated 2025-05-09)
Completed. All enhancements have been implemented and tested. The verification service now supports multiple signature algorithms (RSA and Ed25519), implements proper OB3 proof verification, and provides comprehensive error handling with a detailed verification status model. Key management has been improved with key type detection and metadata storage. All tests are passing.

## Recent Updates (2025-05-09)
- Improved error handling for unknown cryptosuites in the verification service
- Added explicit handling for unknown cryptosuites instead of silently falling back to defaults
- Updated JSDoc comments for asynchronous methods in the KeyService
- Fixed TypeScript errors in the signature utility
- All tests are passing and the code is now TypeScript compliant
