# Security Middleware Migration

## Task Description

Migrate the security middleware from Elysia to Hono. This task is essential for ensuring proper security in the OpenBadges Modular Server after the framework migration.

## Priority

High

## Effort Estimate

1-2 days

## Dependencies

None

## Status

Completed on May 10, 2025

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Rate limiting middleware is migrated to Hono
2. ✅ Security headers middleware is migrated to Hono
3. ✅ Static assets middleware is migrated to Hono
4. ✅ All middleware is integrated into the main application
5. ✅ Tests are written for the migrated middleware
6. ✅ Documentation is updated to reflect the changes

## Implementation Steps

1. ✅ **Migrated rate limiting middleware**
   - Identified the current rate limiting implementation in Elysia
   - Used Hono-compatible rate limiting solution: `hono-rate-limiter`
   - Implemented a rate limiting middleware for Hono
   - Integrated the middleware into the main application

2. ✅ **Migrated security headers middleware**
   - Identified the current security headers implementation in Elysia
   - Used Hono's built-in `secureHeaders` middleware
   - Implemented a security headers middleware for Hono
   - Integrated the middleware into the main application

3. ✅ **Migrated static assets middleware**
   - Determined that static assets middleware was needed in the Hono implementation
   - Identified the current static assets implementation in Elysia
   - Implemented a static assets router for Hono
   - Integrated the middleware into the main application

4. ✅ **Updated the API router**
   - Modified `src/api/api.router.ts`
   - Implemented the TODOs for security middleware
   - Ensured the middleware is applied in the correct order

5. ✅ **Wrote tests for the migrated middleware**
   - Created unit tests for the security middleware
   - Created unit tests for the static assets middleware
   - Ensured all tests pass

6. ✅ **Updated documentation**
   - Updated the code documentation to reflect the changes
   - Documented the configuration options for each middleware
   - Documented the security features provided by each middleware

## Technical Notes

- Used Hono's built-in middleware for security features
- Used existing Hono middleware packages where possible
- Applied middleware in the correct order for optimal security

## Testing

- ✅ Wrote unit tests for each middleware
- ✅ Tested the middleware with different configuration options
- ✅ Ensured the middleware provides the expected security features
- ✅ Verified that the middleware doesn't interfere with normal operation

## Documentation

- ✅ Updated the documentation to reflect the changes
- ✅ Documented the configuration options for each middleware
- ✅ Documented the security features provided by each middleware

## Completion Summary

The security middleware migration was successfully completed. The rate limiting, security headers, and static assets middleware were all migrated to Hono and integrated into the main application. Tests were written to ensure the middleware functions correctly and provides the expected security features. The code documentation was updated to reflect the changes.
