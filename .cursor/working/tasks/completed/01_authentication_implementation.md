# Task: Authentication Implementation

## Priority
High - Estimated effort: 3-4 days

## Background
The authentication system has a well-designed architecture with support for multiple authentication methods (API keys, Basic Auth, OAuth2), but the implementation is incomplete. While the auth adapters are defined, they are not fully integrated with the API routes. There is no comprehensive role-based access control system, and user management functionality is missing. This task is critical for securing the API before production deployment.

## Objectives
- Fully integrate authentication middleware with all API routes
- Implement role-based access control
- Add user management functionality
- Ensure proper security for all API operations

## Implementation Details
The authentication system needs to be completed by integrating the existing auth adapters with all API routes and implementing a role-based access control system. The implementation should follow the existing architecture and use the configured authentication providers.

### Technical Approach
1. Extend the existing auth middleware to support role-based access control
2. Create a user management system with appropriate repositories and controllers
3. Integrate auth middleware with all API routes
4. Implement proper error handling for authentication failures
5. Add comprehensive logging for authentication events

## Acceptance Criteria
- All API routes are protected by authentication middleware
- Role-based access control is implemented and enforced
- User management functionality is available through API endpoints
- Authentication events are properly logged
- Unit and integration tests cover authentication scenarios
- Documentation is updated to reflect authentication requirements

- `/src/auth/adapters/` - Authentication adapters for different methods
- `/src/auth/middleware/auth.middleware.ts` - Authentication middleware
- `/src/api/api.router.ts` - API routes that need authentication
- `/src/config/config.ts` - Authentication configuration

## Dependencies
- None, but this task is a prerequisite for deployment

## Notes
- Consider using JWT for stateless authentication
- Ensure proper error messages that don't leak sensitive information
- Consider rate limiting for authentication attempts
- Implement proper password hashing if storing user credentials

## Progress
- [x] Extend auth middleware to support role-based access control
- [x] Create user entity and repository
- [x] Implement user management controller and routes
- [x] Integrate auth middleware with all badge operation API routes
- [x] Add basic logging for authentication events
- [x] Fix TypeScript errors in middleware implementation
- [x] Submit PR #24 with complete authentication implementation
- [x] Enhance logging for comprehensive authentication event tracking
- [x] Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for authentication
- [x] Update API documentation with authentication requirements

### Revised Tasks Based on Assessment
1. **Route Protection**
   - [x] Apply RBAC middleware to badge class endpoints
   - [x] Apply RBAC middleware to issuer endpoints
   - [x] Apply RBAC middleware to assertion endpoints
   - [x] Apply RBAC middleware to backpack endpoints
   - [x] Fix TypeScript errors in middleware implementation using guard pattern

2. **Permission Enforcement**
   - [x] Add permission checks to badge class controller operations
   - [x] Add permission checks to issuer controller operations
   - [x] Add permission checks to assertion controller operations
   - [x] Add permission checks to backpack controller operations

3. **Testing & Documentation**
   - [x] Set up authentication integration test structure
   - [x] Implement comprehensive authentication integration tests
   - [x] Create authorization unit tests for controllers
   - [x] Document authentication flow in API documentation
   - [x] Create user guide for authentication configuration

## Current Status (Updated 2025-05-06)

The authentication system implementation is now complete and has been submitted as PR #24. All TypeScript errors have been fixed, and the code passes all linting checks and tests.

### Completed Components:

1. **Authentication Framework**
   - Multiple authentication adapters (API Key, Basic Auth, JWT) are implemented
   - JWT-based session management is in place
   - Authentication middleware is properly structured and integrated

2. **User Management**
   - User entity with roles and permissions is implemented
   - User repository and service layers are in place for both PostgreSQL and SQLite
   - User controller with CRUD operations is implemented

3. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Comprehensive RBAC middleware is implemented and integrated
   - Role and permission enums are defined and used consistently
   - Default role permissions are configured
   - Helper functions for common authorization scenarios (requireAdmin, requireSelfOrAdmin, etc.)

4. **API Integration**
   - User management API endpoints are implemented and protected
   - Authentication endpoints (login, register) are implemented
   - Admin user creation logic is in place
   - All API routes are properly protected with appropriate middleware

### Remaining Work:

1. **Route Protection** ✅
   - ✅ The main API routes for badge operations are now consistently protected
   - ✅ RBAC middleware has been applied to all relevant endpoints
   - ✅ Fixed TypeScript errors in middleware usage by using the correct guard pattern

2. **Permission Enforcement** ✅
   - ✅ Permission checks are now consistently applied in controllers
   - ✅ All operations now verify appropriate permissions

3. **Documentation** ✅
   - ✅ Authentication and authorization documentation is now complete
   - ✅ API documentation has been updated with auth requirements
   - ✅ Created comprehensive documentation in docs/authentication.md

4. **Testing** ✅
   - ✅ Basic authentication tests are implemented
   - ✅ Integration tests for auth.integration.test.ts are now implemented
   - ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for auth scenarios is in place
   - ✅ Enhanced logging for authentication events is implemented

The authentication implementation is now complete. All planned tasks have been completed, including documentation, testing, and enhanced logging.
