# End-to-End Testing

## Task Description

Implement comprehensive end-to-end tests for the OpenBadges Modular Server. This task is essential for ensuring the reliability and correctness of the system as a whole.

## Priority

High

## Effort Estimate

2-3 days

## Dependencies

- Task 01: API Router Integration
- Task 02: Security Middleware Migration

## Acceptance Criteria

1. End-to-end tests are implemented for all core functionality
2. End-to-end tests are implemented for backpack functionality
3. End-to-end tests are implemented for user management
4. End-to-end tests are implemented for authentication
5. All tests pass consistently
6. Tests are documented and maintainable

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the test environment**
   - Create a dedicated test environment with a clean database
   - Configure the application for testing
   - Set up test fixtures and helpers

2. **Implement tests for core functionality**
   - Create tests for issuer management
   - Create tests for badge class management
   - Create tests for assertion management
   - Create tests for verification

3. **Implement tests for backpack functionality**
   - Create tests for platform registration
   - Create tests for user registration
   - Create tests for assertion storage
   - Create tests for backpack retrieval

4. **Implement tests for user management**
   - Create tests for user registration
   - Create tests for user authentication
   - Create tests for user profile management
   - Create tests for user permissions

5. **Implement tests for authentication**
   - Create tests for API key authentication
   - Create tests for JWT authentication
   - Create tests for OAuth2 authentication (if implemented)
   - Create tests for authorization

6. **Implement tests for error handling**
   - Create tests for invalid input
   - Create tests for unauthorized access
   - Create tests for server errors
   - Create tests for edge cases

7. **Document the tests**
   - Document the test setup and configuration
   - Document the test fixtures and helpers
   - Document the test cases and expected results
   - Document how to run the tests

## Technical Notes

- Use the existing test setup in `test/e2e/setup-test-app.ts`
- Use random ports to avoid conflicts
- Clean up the database before and after each test
- Use the Hono test client for API tests
- Consider using a test framework like Playwright for browser-based tests

## Testing

- Run the tests in a clean environment
- Verify that all tests pass consistently
- Check test coverage to ensure all functionality is tested
- Verify that tests are isolated and don't interfere with each other

## Documentation

- Document the test setup and configuration
- Document the test fixtures and helpers
- Document the test cases and expected results
- Document how to run the tests
