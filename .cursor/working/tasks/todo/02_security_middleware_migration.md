# Security Middleware Migration

## Task Description

Migrate the security middleware from Elysia to Hono. This task is essential for ensuring proper security in the OpenBadges Modular Server after the framework migration.

## Priority

High

## Effort Estimate

1-2 days

## Dependencies

None

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Rate limiting middleware is migrated to Hono
2. Security headers middleware is migrated to Hono
3. Static assets middleware is migrated to Hono (if needed)
4. All middleware is integrated into the main application
5. Tests are written for the migrated middleware
6. Documentation is updated to reflect the changes

## Implementation Steps

1. **Migrate rate limiting middleware**
   - Identify the current rate limiting implementation in Elysia
   - Research Hono-compatible rate limiting solutions
   - Implement a rate limiting middleware for Hono
   - Integrate the middleware into the main application

2. **Migrate security headers middleware**
   - Identify the current security headers implementation in Elysia
   - Research Hono-compatible security headers solutions
   - Implement a security headers middleware for Hono
   - Integrate the middleware into the main application

3. **Migrate static assets middleware (if needed)**
   - Determine if static assets middleware is needed in the Hono implementation
   - If needed, identify the current static assets implementation in Elysia
   - Research Hono-compatible static assets solutions
   - Implement a static assets middleware for Hono
   - Integrate the middleware into the main application

4. **Update the API router**
   - Open `src/api/api.router.ts`
   - Uncomment and implement the TODOs for security middleware
   - Ensure the middleware is applied in the correct order

5. **Write tests for the migrated middleware**
   - Create unit tests for the rate limiting middleware
   - Create unit tests for the security headers middleware
   - Create unit tests for the static assets middleware (if implemented)
   - Ensure all tests pass

6. **Update documentation**
   - Update the documentation to reflect the changes
   - Document the configuration options for each middleware
   - Document the security features provided by each middleware

## Technical Notes

- The API router has TODOs for migrating security middleware
- Hono has built-in middleware for some security features
- Consider using existing Hono middleware packages where possible
- Ensure the middleware is applied in the correct order

## Testing

- Write unit tests for each middleware
- Test the middleware with different configuration options
- Ensure the middleware provides the expected security features
- Verify that the middleware doesn't interfere with normal operation

## Documentation

- Update the documentation to reflect the changes
- Document the configuration options for each middleware
- Document the security features provided by each middleware
