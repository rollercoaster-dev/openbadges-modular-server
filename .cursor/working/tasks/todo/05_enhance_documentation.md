# Enhance Documentation

> _Intended for: [x] Internal Task  [x] GitHub Issue  [ ] Pull Request_

## 1. Goal & Context
- **Objective:** Improve developer onboarding and system understanding by adding more examples to API documentation, creating a developer guide, and documenting performance considerations.
- **Branch:** `docs/enhance-documentation`
- **Energy Level:** [Low/Medium] ðŸ”‹
- **Focus Strategy:** [Writing Sprints, Review Cycles]
- **Status:** [ðŸŸ¡ In Progress]

### Background
The code review noted that while documentation exists, it could be enhanced with more API examples, a guide for extension, and performance notes. Good documentation is vital for maintainability and attracting contributors. (Ref: `code-review.md`)

## 2. Resources & Dependencies
- **Prerequisites:** [Good understanding of the codebase, API structure, and intended extension points]
- **Key Files/Tools:**
    - Existing API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger spec file)
    - `README.md`
    - Code comments (JSDoc)
    - Potentially a new `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` file
- **Additional Needs:** [Clarification on key extension points (e.g., adding new database adapters), results from performance testing/optimization tasks]

## 3. Planning & Steps
### Quick Wins
- [ ] Add one detailed example request/response pair to a core API endpoint in the OpenAPI spec (30 min)
- [ ] Outline the main sections for the `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` (30 min)

### Major Steps
1. [Add Comprehensive Examples to API Documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)] (2-4 hours) ðŸŽ¯
    - Cover common use cases for issuance, verification, etc.
    - Include examples for both OBv2 and OBv3 where applicable.
2. [Create Initial Draft of Developer Guide] (3-5 hours) ðŸŽ¯
    - Explain core architecture (DDD, modularity).
    - Detail how to add new database modules.
    - Cover setup, configuration, testing, and contribution guidelines.
3. [Document Performance Considerations] (1-2 hours) ðŸŽ¯
    - Summarize findings from optimization task.
    - Provide guidance on scaling or potential bottlenecks.
4. [Review and Refine All Documentation] (1-2 hours) ðŸŽ¯

### Testing & Definition of Done
- [ ] API documentation includes clear examples for key endpoints.
- [ ] Developer guide exists and covers core extension points and setup.
- [ ] Performance considerations are documented.
- [ ] Documentation is clear, well-formatted, and reviewed.

## 4. Execution & Progress

### Current Status (Updated 2025-05-05)

This task is in progress but requires further attention. Based on a review of the implementation plan and acceptance criteria, here's the current status:

#### Completed:
- Initial task planning and documentation structure identification
- Some API endpoints have basic documentation in place
- README contains fundamental project information

#### Remaining (Prioritized):
1. **High Priority:**
   - Add comprehensive examples to API documentation for core endpoints
   - Create initial draft of developer guide with architecture explanation
   - Document extension points (especially database modules)

2. **Medium Priority:**
   - Document performance considerations and scaling guidance
   - Enhance setup and configuration documentation
   - Add examples for both OBv2 and OBv3 formats

3. **Lower Priority:**
   - Review and refine all documentation for clarity and completeness
   - Ensure documentation follows accessibility best practices
   - Add diagrams to illustrate system architecture

#### Next Steps:
1. Add detailed request/response examples to at least one core API endpoint
2. Create outline for DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md with main sections
3. Document the database abstraction layer and how to extend it

**Context Resume Point:**
_Last worked on:_ Initial documentation assessment
_Next action:_ Add examples to API documentation
_Blockers:_ May need input on performance considerations from related optimization tasks

## 6. Parking Lot (Tangential Ideas)
- [Create tutorials for specific use cases]
- [Automate documentation generation where possible]

## 7. References & Links
- [`code-review.md`](./code-review.md)
- [Existing API Docs](URL)
- [`README.md`](./README.md)

**Accessibility/UX Considerations:**
[Ensure documentation is accessible (e.g., good contrast, semantic structure in Markdown)]
