# MVP Code Review Plan

**Goal:** Conduct a systematic review of the `openbadges-modular-server` MVP codebase, focusing on Open Badges 3.0 alignment, TypeScript quality (especially `openbadges-types` usage), and adherence to the DRY principle. The review will be broken down by feature, with findings and refactoring for each feature consolidated into a separate Pull Request.

**Proposed Feature Review Order:**

1.  **Platform Management & Authentication/Authorization:** Reviewing tenant setup, user roles, JWT handling, etc.
2.  **BadgeClass Management:** Checking the definition, creation, and updating of badge classes.
3.  **Badge Issuance:** Examining the process of issuing badges based on defined classes.
4.  **Assertion Retrieval & Validation:** Verifying how badge assertions are served and validated.
5.  **Backpack/Integration Points:** (If applicable) Reviewing any code related to external system interactions.
6.  **Database Layer:** A cross-cutting review of Drizzle schema, mappers, migrations, and type conversion utilities for both PostgreSQL and SQLite, ensuring consistency and correctness.

**Review Process per Feature:**

*   **Locate Code:** Identify all relevant source files (services, controllers, routes, mappers, etc.).
*   **Open Badges Alignment:** Compare implementation against the Open Badges 3.0 specification.
*   **TypeScript Review:** Check `openbadges-types` usage, type safety, and best practices.
*   **DRY Analysis:** Identify and refactor repetitive code patterns.
*   **Document & Refactor:** Record findings and implement necessary changes.
*   **Create PR:** Consolidate all changes for the feature into a single, focused Pull Request.

**Next Step:**

Begin review with **Platform Management & Authentication/Authorization**.
