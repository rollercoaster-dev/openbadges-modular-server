# Strengthen Security Measures

> _Intended for: [x] Internal Task  [x] GitHub Issue  [ ] Pull Request_

## 1. Goal & Context
- **Objective:** Implement recommended security enhancements including API rate limiting, improved input validation/sanitization, and CSRF protection where applicable.
- **Branch:** `feat/strengthen-security`
- **Energy Level:** [Medium/High] ðŸ”‹
- **Focus Strategy:** [Security Review Checklist, Focused Work Blocks]
- **Status:** [ðŸŸ¡ In Progress]

### Background
The code review recommended specific security hardening steps. Implementing rate limiting helps prevent abuse, robust input validation guards against injection attacks, and CSRF protection secures state-changing operations initiated from web contexts. (Ref: `code-review.md`)

## 2. Resources & Dependencies
- **Prerequisites:** [Understanding of common web vulnerabilities (OWASP), familiarity with Node.js/Bun security practices]
- **Key Files/Tools:**
    - API middleware (`src/api/middleware`?)
    - Input validation library (e.g., Zod)
    - CORS configuration
    - Potential rate-limiting library (e.g., `express-rate-limit` adapter or equivalent)
    - Potential CSRF protection library (e.g., `csurf` adapter or equivalent)
- **Additional Needs:** [Decision on specific libraries for rate limiting/CSRF, review of authentication mechanism context for CSRF applicability]

## 3. Planning & Steps
### Quick Wins
- [ ] Research and select suitable libraries/strategies for rate limiting and CSRF (if needed) (30-60 min)
- [ ] Review CORS configuration for unnecessary permissiveness (15 min)

### Major Steps
1. [Implement Rate Limiting Middleware for Key API Endpoints] (2-3 hours) ðŸŽ¯
2. [Conduct Thorough Review of Input Validation/Sanitization Points] (2-4 hours) ðŸŽ¯
    - Focus on data used in DB queries, external calls, or rendered output.
    - Ensure validation schemas are strict where appropriate.
3. [Implement CSRF Protection for Non-GET Endpoints Requiring Authentication (if applicable)] (2-3 hours) ðŸŽ¯
4. [Update/Tighten CORS Configuration as Needed] (30 min) ðŸŽ¯

### Testing & Definition of Done
- [ ] Rate limiting is functional and configured for relevant endpoints.
- [ ] Input validation review completed, and necessary improvements implemented.
- [ ] CSRF protection is in place for relevant state-changing, authenticated endpoints.
- [ ] CORS policy is appropriately configured (not overly permissive).
- [ ] Security measures tested (e.g., triggering rate limits, attempting invalid input, testing CSRF tokens).

## 6. Parking Lot (Tangential Ideas)
- [Integrate Web Application Firewall (WAF)]
- [Implement security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)]
- [Conduct external security audit/penetration testing]
