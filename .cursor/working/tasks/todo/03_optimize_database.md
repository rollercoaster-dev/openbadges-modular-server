# Optimize Database Access

> _Intended for: [x] Internal Task  [x] GitHub Issue  [ ] Pull Request_

## 1. Goal & Context
- **Objective:** Improve database performance and resource utilization by implementing connection pooling, caching for frequently accessed data, and optimizing critical queries.
- **Branch:** `feat/optimize-database`
- **Energy Level:** [Medium] ðŸ”‹
- **Focus Strategy:** [Performance Analysis Tools, Benchmarking]
- **Status:** [ðŸŸ¡ In Progress]

### Background
The code review suggested optimizing database access as a potential improvement area. Efficient database interaction is key to application scalability and responsiveness, especially under load. This task focuses on connection pooling, caching, and query optimization. (Ref: `code-review.md`)

## 2. Resources & Dependencies
- **Prerequisites:** [Understanding of database performance concepts, familiarity with the ORM (Drizzle?) and database system (PostgreSQL?)]
- **Key Files/Tools:**
    - Database connection setup (`src/infrastructure/database/factory.ts`?)
    - Repository implementations (`src/infrastructure/database/modules/**/repositories/**`?)
    - ORM query builder methods
    - Caching library/mechanism (e.g., Redis, in-memory cache like `node-cache`)
    - Database query analysis tools (e.g., `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`)
- **Additional Needs:** [Decision on caching strategy/tool, identification of frequently accessed data and critical queries]

## 3. Planning & Steps
### Quick Wins
- [ ] Verify if connection pooling is already implicitly handled by the ORM/driver or configure it (30 min)
- [ ] Identify 1-2 candidates for caching (e.g., issuer profile, badge class definitions) (30 min)

### Major Steps
1. [Implement/Configure Database Connection Pooling] (1-2 hours) ðŸŽ¯
2. [Identify Frequently Accessed, Read-Heavy Data for Caching] (1 hour) ðŸŽ¯
3. [Implement Caching Strategy for Identified Data] (3-5 hours) ðŸŽ¯
    - Select and integrate caching library/mechanism.
    - Implement cache population and invalidation logic.
4. [Analyze and Optimize Critical Database Queries] (2-4 hours) ðŸŽ¯
    - Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` or similar tools.
    - Identify slow queries and optimize (e.g., add indexes, refactor queries).

### Testing & Definition of Done
- [ ] Connection pooling is confirmed to be active and configured appropriately.
- [ ] Caching implemented for selected data, with measurable performance improvement.
- [ ] Cache invalidation logic is correct.
- [ ] Critical queries identified and optimized.
- [ ] Performance tests (if available from testing task) show improvement or no degradation.
