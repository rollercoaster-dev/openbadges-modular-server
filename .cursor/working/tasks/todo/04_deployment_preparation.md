# Task: Deployment Preparation

## Priority
High - Estimated effort: 2 days

## Background
While the application has Docker configuration files, the deployment process is not fully documented or tested. Preparing for deployment involves finalizing Docker configurations, creating comprehensive deployment documentation, and implementing health checks and monitoring. This task is essential for ensuring a smooth transition to production.

## Objectives
- Finalize Docker container configuration
- Create comprehensive deployment documentation
- Implement health checks and monitoring
- Prepare CI/CD pipeline configuration

## Implementation Details
The deployment preparation involves finalizing the Docker configuration, creating comprehensive documentation, and implementing health checks and monitoring. The implementation should ensure that the application can be easily deployed to production environments.

### Technical Approach
1. Review and finalize the Docker configuration
2. Create comprehensive deployment documentation
3. Implement health checks for all critical components
4. Configure logging for production environments
5. Prepare CI/CD pipeline configuration

## Acceptance Criteria
- Docker configuration is finalized and tested
- Comprehensive deployment documentation is available
- Health checks are implemented for all critical components
- Logging is configured for production environments
- CI/CD pipeline configuration is prepared
- Database migrations are automated for deployment

- Task 03_database_testing_completion should be completed first

## Notes
- Consider using Docker Compose for local development
- Ensure proper environment variable configuration
- Document all required environment variables
- Consider using a reverse proxy for production deployments
- Implement proper logging for production environments
