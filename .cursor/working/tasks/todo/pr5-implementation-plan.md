# PR 5: Address Minor Issues & Investigate Types

## Goal
Clean up remaining smaller issues and improve type safety across the codebase, focusing on edge cases and type conversions.

## Tasks

### 1. Investigate and Fix IRI Type Import (#4fc912b4)
- [x] Review current usage of `Shared.IRI` type across the codebase
- [x] Ensure consistent usage of IRI utilities (`toIRI`, `createIRI`, etc.)
- [x] Fix any type casting issues related to `Shared.IRI`
- [x] Update documentation for working with IRI types

### 2. Address Type Conversion Edge Cases (#65)
- [x] Review `convertJson` function in `type-conversion.ts` to handle edge cases
- [x] Improve error handling in type conversion utilities
- [x] Add additional tests for edge cases in type conversion
- [x] Ensure consistent usage of type conversion utilities across repositories

### 3. Address Other Medium/Minor Findings
- [ ] Review and address issues from PR #4 (Neuro-friendly logging system)
  - [x] Implemented and verified integration tests for SqliteAssertionRepository query logging
- [ ] Review and address issues from PR #17 (PostgreSQL CI testing)
- [ ] Fix any remaining TypeScript errors or warnings
- [ ] Remove unnecessary type assertions (`as`) where possible
- [ ] Improve documentation for type handling

### 4. Testing and Validation
- [x] Run TypeScript type checking to ensure no new errors
- [x] Run tests to ensure all functionality works correctly
- [x] Verify that all edge cases are handled properly
- [ ] Document any remaining issues for future PRs

## Implementation Strategy
1. Start with the IRI type investigation as it affects many parts of the codebase
2. Then address the type conversion edge cases
3. Finally, address the other medium/minor findings
4. Run tests and validation to ensure everything works correctly

## Expected Outcome
- Improved type safety across the codebase
- Better handling of edge cases in type conversions
- Reduced number of type assertions
- Clearer documentation for working with types
