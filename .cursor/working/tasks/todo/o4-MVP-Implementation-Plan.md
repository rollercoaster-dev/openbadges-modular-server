# OpenBadges Modular Server - MVP Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version of the OpenBadges Modular Server. The plan is organized by feature area and includes specific tasks that need to be completed.

## Current Status (Updated 2025-05-05)

The MVP implementation has made significant progress, with many core features completed. Based on a review of the implementation plan and current codebase, here's the current status:

### Completed Areas:
- Core functionality (CRUD operations, validation, error handling)
- Database support (both PostgreSQL and SQLite)
- API endpoints (RESTful endpoints, JSON-LD context, pagination, filtering)
- Basic authentication and authorization
- Assertion verification and signing
- API documentation and database schema documentation
- Unit tests for core functionality and integration tests for API endpoints

### Remaining Areas (Prioritized):
1. **High Priority:**
   - Deployment documentation
   - End-to-end tests
   - Docker container and deployment configurations
   - Health checks implementation

2. **Medium Priority:**
   - User guide documentation
   - Performance tests
   - Error tracking implementation
   - CI/CD pipeline setup

3. **Lower Priority:**
   - Performance monitoring
   - Advanced features planned for post-MVP releases

### Next Steps:
1. Complete the deployment documentation to facilitate easier setup
2. Implement end-to-end tests to ensure system reliability
3. Create Docker container and deployment configurations
4. Implement health checks for system monitoring

### Progress Summary:
- **Core Features:** ~100% complete
- **Database Support:** ~100% complete
- **API Endpoints:** ~100% complete
- **Authentication:** ~90% complete (may need refinement)
- **Documentation:** ~70% complete
- **Testing:** ~60% complete
- **Deployment:** ~20% complete
- **Monitoring:** ~30% complete

Overall, the MVP is approximately 80% complete, with the remaining work focused on deployment, comprehensive testing, and documentation.

- ✅ Implement JSON-LD context for OpenBadges entities
- ✅ Implement content negotiation for different response formats
- ✅ Implement pagination for list endpoints
- ✅ Implement filtering for list endpoints
- ✅ Implement sorting for list endpoints
- ✅ Implement search for list endpoints

## 4. Authentication and Authorization

- ✅ Implement API key authentication
  - ✅ Create API key generation and validation
  - ✅ Implement API key storage and retrieval
  - ✅ Add middleware for API key validation

- ✅ Implement basic authorization (is this a good idea? Would JWT or OAuth Be better?)
  - ✅ Define roles and permissions
  - ✅ Implement role-based access control
  - ✅ Add middleware for authorization

## 5. Assertion Verification

- ✅ Implement assertion verification
  - ✅ Verify assertion signature
  - ✅ Verify assertion expiration
  - ✅ Verify assertion revocation status

- ✅ Implement assertion signing
  - ✅ Generate key pairs for signing
  - ✅ Sign assertions with private key
  - ✅ Verify assertions with public key

## 6. Documentation

- ✅ Create API documentation
- ✅ Create database schema documentation
- ⬜ Create deployment documentation
- ⬜ Create user guide

## 7. Testing

- ✅ Implement unit tests for core functionality
- ✅ Implement integration tests for API endpoints
- ⬜ Implement end-to-end tests
- ⬜ Implement performance tests

## 8. Deployment

- ⬜ Create Docker container for the server
- ⬜ Create Docker Compose configuration for local development
- ⬜ Create Kubernetes configuration for production deployment
- ⬜ Implement CI/CD pipeline

## 9. Monitoring and Logging

- ✅ Implement basic logging
- ⬜ Implement error tracking
- ⬜ Implement performance monitoring
- ⬜ Implement health checks

## Next Steps

After completing the MVP, the following features will be considered for future releases:

1. OAuth2 authentication
2. Social login integration
3. Webhook support for events
4. Advanced search capabilities
5. Batch operations for assertions
6. Integration with learning management systems

9. Advanced caching strategies
10. Pluggable storage backends (beyond PostgreSQL and SQLite)

### OpenBadges-Specific Enhancements

1. Enhanced verification options (multiple verification methods beyond basic hosted verification)
2. Backpack integration (allowing recipients to collect and store badges)
3. Endorsement support (allowing third parties to endorse badges)
4. Evidence handling improvements (better support for linking to evidence)
5. Revocation improvements (more sophisticated revocation mechanisms)
6. Badge expiration handling (better support for temporary badges)
7. Integration with credential ecosystems (Verifiable Credentials, etc.)
8. Improved cryptographic signing options
9. Batch issuance capabilities (issuing badges to many recipients at once)
10. Standards compliance testing (ensuring full compliance with the latest OpenBadges spec)
