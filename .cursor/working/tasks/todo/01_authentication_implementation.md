# Task: Authentication Implementation

## Priority
High - Estimated effort: 3-4 days

## Background
The authentication system has a well-designed architecture with support for multiple authentication methods (API keys, Basic Auth, OAuth2), but the implementation is incomplete. While the auth adapters are defined, they are not fully integrated with the API routes. There is no comprehensive role-based access control system, and user management functionality is missing. This task is critical for securing the API before production deployment.

## Objectives
- Fully integrate authentication middleware with all API routes
- Implement role-based access control
- Add user management functionality
- Ensure proper security for all API operations

## Implementation Details
The authentication system needs to be completed by integrating the existing auth adapters with all API routes and implementing a role-based access control system. The implementation should follow the existing architecture and use the configured authentication providers.

### Technical Approach
1. Extend the existing auth middleware to support role-based access control
2. Create a user management system with appropriate repositories and controllers
3. Integrate auth middleware with all API routes
4. Implement proper error handling for authentication failures
5. Add comprehensive logging for authentication events

## Acceptance Criteria
- All API routes are protected by authentication middleware
- Role-based access control is implemented and enforced
- User management functionality is available through API endpoints
- Authentication events are properly logged
- Unit and integration tests cover authentication scenarios
- Documentation is updated to reflect authentication requirements

- `/src/auth/middleware/auth.middleware.ts` - Authentication middleware
- `/src/api/api.router.ts` - API routes that need authentication
- `/src/config/config.ts` - Authentication configuration

## Dependencies
- None, but this task is a prerequisite for deployment

## Notes
- Consider using JWT for stateless authentication
- Ensure proper error messages that don't leak sensitive information
- Consider rate limiting for authentication attempts
- Implement proper password hashing if storing user credentials

## Progress
- [x] Extend auth middleware to support role-based access control
- [x] Create user entity and repository
- [x] Implement user management controller and routes
- [x] Integrate auth middleware with all badge operation API routes
- [x] Add basic logging for authentication events
- [ ] Enhance logging for comprehensive authentication event tracking
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for authentication
- [ ] Update API documentation with authentication requirements

### Revised Tasks Based on Assessment
1. **Route Protection**
   - [x] Apply RBAC middleware to badge class endpoints
   - [x] Apply RBAC middleware to issuer endpoints
   - [x] Apply RBAC middleware to assertion endpoints
   - [x] Apply RBAC middleware to backpack endpoints

2. **Permission Enforcement**
   - [x] Add permission checks to badge class controller operations
   - [x] Add permission checks to issuer controller operations
   - [x] Add permission checks to assertion controller operations
   - [x] Add permission checks to backpack controller operations

3. **Testing & Documentation**
   - [ ] Create authentication integration tests
   - [ ] Create authorization unit tests for controllers
   - [ ] Document authentication flow in API documentation
   - [ ] Create user guide for authentication configuration

## Current Status (Updated 2025-05-05)

After a thorough review of the codebase, I've found that the authentication system is significantly more complete than initially assessed. The implementation is approximately 80% complete with a well-structured architecture and most core components in place.

### Completed Components:

1. **Authentication Framework**
   - Multiple authentication adapters (API Key, Basic Auth, OAuth2) are implemented
   - JWT-based session management is in place
   - Authentication middleware is properly structured

2. **User Management**
   - User entity with roles and permissions is implemented
   - User repository and service layers are in place
   - User controller with CRUD operations exists

3. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Comprehensive RBAC middleware is implemented
   - Role and permission enums are defined
   - Default role permissions are configured
   - Helper functions for common authorization scenarios (requireAdmin, requireSelfOrAdmin, etc.)

4. **API Integration**
   - User management API endpoints are defined
   - Authentication endpoints (login, register) are implemented
   - Admin user creation logic is in place

### Remaining Work:

1. **Route Protection**
   - The main API routes for badge operations are not consistently protected
   - Need to apply RBAC middleware to all relevant endpoints

2. **Permission Enforcement**
   - Permission checks are not consistently applied in controllers
   - Need to ensure all operations verify appropriate permissions

3. **Documentation**
   - Authentication and authorization documentation is incomplete
   - API documentation needs to be updated with auth requirements

4. **Testing**
   - Authentication and authorization tests are limited
   - Need comprehensive test coverage for auth scenarios

The task scope has been refined based on this assessment. Instead of implementing the entire authentication system from scratch, the focus should be on completing the integration with existing API routes and ensuring consistent permission enforcement.
