# Task: Authentication Implementation

## Priority
High - Estimated effort: 3-4 days

## Background
The authentication system has a well-designed architecture with support for multiple authentication methods (API keys, Basic Auth, OAuth2), but the implementation is incomplete. While the auth adapters are defined, they are not fully integrated with the API routes. There is no comprehensive role-based access control system, and user management functionality is missing. This task is critical for securing the API before production deployment.

## Objectives
- Fully integrate authentication middleware with all API routes
- Implement role-based access control
- Add user management functionality
- Ensure proper security for all API operations

## Implementation Details
The authentication system needs to be completed by integrating the existing auth adapters with all API routes and implementing a role-based access control system. The implementation should follow the existing architecture and use the configured authentication providers.

### Technical Approach
1. Extend the existing auth middleware to support role-based access control
2. Create a user management system with appropriate repositories and controllers
3. Integrate auth middleware with all API routes
4. Implement proper error handling for authentication failures
5. Add comprehensive logging for authentication events

## Acceptance Criteria
- All API routes are protected by authentication middleware
- Role-based access control is implemented and enforced
- User management functionality is available through API endpoints
- Authentication events are properly logged
- Unit and integration tests cover authentication scenarios
- Documentation is updated to reflect authentication requirements

## Dependencies
- None, but this task is a prerequisite for deployment

## Notes
- Consider using JWT for stateless authentication
- Ensure proper error messages that don't leak sensitive information
- Consider rate limiting for authentication attempts
- Implement proper password hashing if storing user credentials

## Progress
- [ ] Extend auth middleware to support role-based access control
- [ ] Create user entity and repository
- [ ] Implement user management controller and routes
- [ ] Integrate auth middleware with all API routes
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging for authentication events
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for authentication
- [ ] Update documentation

## Current Status (Updated 2025-05-05)
Not started. This task is identified as a high priority item from the codebase review.
