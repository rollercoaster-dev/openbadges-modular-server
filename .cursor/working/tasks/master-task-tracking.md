## Critical Path

The following tasks form the critical path for MVP completion:

1. **Authentication Implementation** - Essential for security
2. **Assertion Signing Enhancement** - Required for proper badge verification
3. **Database Testing Completion** - Ensures production database reliability
4. **Deployment Preparation** - Final step for production readiness

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (Current)
- Complete high-priority tasks (01-04)
