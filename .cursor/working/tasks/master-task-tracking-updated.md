# OpenBadges Modular Server - Master Task Tracking

## Introduction

The OpenBadges Modular Server is a headless server implementation of the OpenBadges standard. This document tracks all tasks related to the development of the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version of the server.

## Project Status

**Current Status:** ~80-85% complete toward MVP
**Last Updated:** May 9, 2025

## Critical Path

The following tasks form the critical path for MVP completion:

1. **[API Router Integration](./todo/01_api_router_integration.md)** - Essential for enabling backpack and user management functionality
2. **[Assertion Signing Enhancement](./todo/02_assertion_signing_enhancement.md)** - Critical for ensuring badge integrity and authenticity
3. **[Security Middleware Migration](./todo/03_security_middleware_migration.md)** - Required for proper security in the Hono framework
4. **[End-to-End Testing](./todo/04_e2e_testing.md)** - Ensures system reliability
5. **[Deployment Preparation](./todo/05_deployment_preparation.md)** - Final step for production readiness

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (Completed)
- ✅ Implement core badge ecosystem components
- ✅ Implement database support
- ✅ Implement basic API endpoints
- ✅ Implement authentication framework
- ✅ Migrate from Elysia to Hono framework

### Phase 2: Integration and Security (Current)
- Complete high-priority tasks (01-02)
- Integrate backpack and user management functionality
- Migrate security middleware to Hono

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance
- Complete medium-priority tasks (03-08)
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage
- Improve documentation

### Phase 4: Deployment and Production Readiness
- Complete deployment preparation
- Set up CI/CD pipeline
- Implement monitoring and health checks
