# Database Optimization Summary

## Overview

We've implemented database optimizations to improve the performance and scalability of the Open Badges API. The main focus was on adding caching to reduce database load and improve response times.

## Implemented Features

### 1. In-Memory Caching

We've added a simple but effective in-memory caching system that:

- Caches entities by ID (issuers, badge classes, assertions)
- Caches collections (badge classes by issuer, assertions by badge class/recipient)
- Automatically invalidates cache entries when data is updated or deleted
- Supports configurable time-to-live (TTL) for cache entries
- Automatically cleans up expired cache entries

### 2. SQLite Database Improvements

We've enhanced the SQLite database implementation to:

- Use caching for all database operations
- Properly handle JSON data
- Improve error handling
- Support configurable cache TTL

### 3. Documentation

We've added comprehensive documentation for:

- The caching implementation
- Database optimization strategies
- Configuration options
- Performance considerations

## Implementation Details

### Cache Utility

The cache utility (`src/utils/cache/cache.ts`) provides:

- A simple key-value store with TTL support
- Methods for getting, setting, and deleting cache entries
- Pattern-based cache invalidation
- Automatic cleanup of expired entries

### Cache Integration

The cache is integrated into the SQLite database implementation:

- Each entity is cached by ID when retrieved
- Collections are cached by their relationship (e.g., badge classes by issuer)
- Cache entries are updated when entities are updated
- Cache entries are deleted when entities are deleted
- Related cache entries are invalidated when relationships change

### Cache Keys

Cache keys follow a consistent pattern:

- `issuer:{id}` - Single issuer by ID
- `badgeClass:{id}` - Single badge class by ID
- `assertion:{id}` - Single assertion by ID
- `badgeClasses:issuer:{issuerId}` - Badge classes for a specific issuer
- `assertions:badgeClass:{badgeClassId}` - Assertions for a specific badge class
- `assertions:recipient:{recipientId}` - Assertions for a specific recipient

## Testing

We've added integration tests that verify:

- Entities are cached after first retrieval
- Cache is updated when entities are updated
- Cache is invalidated when entities are deleted
- Cache entries expire after the TTL
- Collections are cached and invalidated correctly

## Configuration

The cache TTL can be configured in the database configuration:

```typescript
// Example configuration
const config = {
  type: 'sqlite',
  sqliteFile: './badges.db',
  cacheTtl: 300000 // 5 minutes in milliseconds
};
```

## Next Steps

1. Fix test issues when running all tests together
2. Add caching to the PostgreSQL database implementation
3. Update the repository factory to support SQLite repositories
4. Update the configuration to include cache settings
5. Add performance metrics and monitoring

## Performance Impact

The caching implementation should significantly improve performance for:

- Repeated requests for the same entity
- Requests for collections that don't change frequently
- Read-heavy workloads

For write-heavy workloads, the cache TTL should be adjusted accordingly to balance cache freshness with performance.
