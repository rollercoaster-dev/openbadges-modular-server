# Release Process Guide

This project uses [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) for automated versioning and release management. This document explains how releases are created and how to use the available release scripts.

## Quick Start

Before creating a release, check if one is needed:

```bash
bun run release:check
```

This will analyze your current state and provide recommendations.

## Automatic Releases

Releases are automatically created when code is merged to the `main` branch. The release process is handled by GitHub Actions and semantic-release with improved error handling and conflict resolution.

### How It Works

1. When code is merged to `main`, the GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/release.yml` is triggered.
2. The workflow first checks if a release is actually needed (no duplicate releases).
3. It runs tests and builds the application to ensure quality.
4. semantic-release analyzes the commit messages since the last release.
5. Based on the commit messages, semantic-release determines the next version number:
   - `fix:` commits trigger a patch release (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
   - `feat:` commits trigger a minor release (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)
   - `feat!:`, `fix!:`, or commits with `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the body trigger a major release (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)
6. semantic-release then:
   - Updates the version in `package.json`
   - Updates the `CHANGELOG.md` file
   - Creates a git tag for the release
   - Creates a GitHub release with release notes
   - Triggers the Docker image build and push workflow (via the tag creation)

### Improved Reliability

The release workflow now includes:
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatically handles concurrent commits by pulling latest changes
- **Retry Logic**: Attempts release up to 3 times if conflicts occur
- **Validation**: Checks for existing releases to prevent duplicates
- **Quality Gates**: Runs tests and builds before releasing
- **Verification**: Confirms the release was created successfully

> **Note**: The version field in `package.json` is managed automatically by semantic-release. You should never manually modify this value as it will be overwritten during the release process.

> **Rule**: `CHANGELOG.md` is fully automated. Do not edit `CHANGELOG.md` manually. Release notes and changelog entries are generated by semantic-release based on commit messages.

### Docker Image Release

When a new version is released, a Docker image is automatically built and pushed to the GitHub Container Registry. The image is tagged with multiple version formats and is available at `ghcr.io/rollercoaster-dev/openbadges-modular-server:<tag>`.

The Docker image build is triggered by the "release published" event from semantic-release. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/docker-build.yml`.

#### Docker Image Tags

Each release creates multiple tags for the Docker image:
- Full semantic version (e.g., `v1.2.3`)
- Major.minor version (e.g., `v1.2`)
- Major version only (e.g., `v1`)

This allows users to choose their preferred level of version pinning:
```bash
# Always use the exact version (most stable)
docker pull ghcr.io/rollercoaster-dev/openbadges-modular-server:v1.2.3

# Use the latest patch version of 1.2.x
docker pull ghcr.io/rollercoaster-dev/openbadges-modular-server:v1.2

# Use the latest minor and patch version of 1.x
docker pull ghcr.io/rollercoaster-dev/openbadges-modular-server:v1
```

#### Manual Docker Builds

You can also manually trigger a Docker build for any tag or branch using the GitHub Actions interface:
1. Go to the Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select the "Build and Push Docker Image" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Enter the tag to build or leave empty for the latest release

## Manual Releases

While the automatic release process is recommended, there are several scripts available for manual releases:

### Check Release Status

Before creating a manual release, check if one is needed:

```bash
bun run release:check
```

This script will:
- Verify you're on the main branch
- Check for uncommitted changes
- Show commits since the last release
- Provide release recommendations

### Dry Run

To see what would happen during a release without actually making changes:

```bash
bun run release:dry-run
```

This will show you the next version number and the changes that would be included in the release.

### Manual Release

To create a release manually (useful for testing or when automatic release fails):

```bash
bun run release:manual
```

This will create a release using semantic-release in manual mode.

### Local Release

To create a release locally (not recommended for production):

```bash
bun run release:local
```

This will create a release locally, updating the version in `package.json` and the `CHANGELOG.md` file, but will not push to GitHub or create a GitHub release.

### Forcing a Specific Release Type

Sometimes you may want to force a specific release type (major, minor, or patch) regardless of the commit messages:

```bash
# Force a major release (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)
bun run release:major

# Force a minor release (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)
bun run release:minor

# Force a patch release (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
bun run release:patch
```

These commands will create a release of the specified type, regardless of the commit messages.

## Release Process Best Practices

### 1. Follow Conventional Commits

Always follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format for your commit messages. This ensures that semantic-release can correctly determine the next version number.

See [commit-convention.md](./commit-convention.md) for details on our commit message format.

### 2. Use Feature Branches

Always work in feature branches and create pull requests to merge your changes to `main`. This ensures that:

- Code is reviewed before being merged
- The release process is triggered only when code is merged to `main`
- Each PR can be associated with a specific release

### 3. Squash Commits When Merging

When merging a PR, consider squashing the commits to create a single, well-formatted commit message. This makes the release notes cleaner and more readable.

### 4. Include Breaking Changes in Commit Messages

If your changes include breaking changes, make sure to include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the commit message body or use the `!` syntax in the type (e.g., `feat!:`). This ensures that semantic-release will create a major release.

Example:

```text
feat!: change API endpoint format

BREAKING CHANGE: The API endpoint format has changed from /api/v1/resource to /api/resource/v1.
```

### 5. Test Before Releasing

Always run tests before creating a release:

```bash
bun test
```

## Troubleshooting

### Silent Release Failures (Manual Tag Issue)

**Issue**: Pushing a git tag manually (e.g., `v1.0.0`) results in a successful workflow run but no GitHub Release is created.

**Root Cause**: This occurs due to a mismatch between manual tagging and the automated release process:

1. **Outdated Workflow Execution**: When a tag is pushed, GitHub Actions runs the workflow file as it existed at the commit the tag points to, which may be an older version lacking correct permissions.
2. **Wrong Trigger**: The current `release.yml` workflow is triggered by pushes to `main` and `beta` branches, not by tags.
3. **Release Prevention Logic**: The workflow checks if a release already exists for the latest commit. Manual tags cause this check to succeed, preventing semantic-release from running.

**Solution**:
- **Never create or push tags manually** for releases
- Use the automated process by pushing conventional commits to `main` or `beta`
- If manual tags were created, consider deleting them to avoid confusion with official releases

### Release Not Created

If a release is not created when you expect it to be:

1. **Check release status first**:
   ```bash
   bun run release:check
   ```

2. **Common issues**:
   - Commit messages not following Conventional Commits format
   - Not on the `main` branch
   - No changes since the last release
   - Duplicate release already exists
   - Manual tags interfering with the automated process

3. **Check GitHub Actions logs** for detailed error information

### Release Workflow Failures

The improved release workflow handles most common failures automatically, but if issues persist:

1. **Concurrent commits**: The workflow now automatically resolves conflicts by pulling latest changes
2. **Temporary GitHub issues**: The workflow retries up to 3 times
3. **Permission issues**: Ensure the workflow has proper permissions (contents: write)

### Manual Recovery

If the automatic release fails completely:

1. **Check what went wrong**:
   ```bash
   bun run release:check
   ```

2. **Try a manual release**:
   ```bash
   bun run release:manual
   ```

3. **If that fails, try a dry run first**:
   ```bash
   bun run release:dry-run
   ```

### NPM-Related Errors

NPM publishing is disabled, but if you see NPM-related errors:

1. The `.releaserc.json` file has `npmPublish: false` configured
2. The workflow creates a dummy `.npmrc` file
3. A dummy NPM token is set in environment variables

### Git Authentication Errors

If you see errors related to Git authentication:

1. The Git configuration in the workflow should be properly set up with user name and email.
2. The workflow should have the correct permissions set (`contents: write`, `issues: write`, `pull-requests: write`).
3. The Git credentials should be properly configured with the GITHUB_TOKEN.

### Docker Build Errors

If you see errors related to Docker image building, check:

1. The Docker build workflow should have the `packages: write` permission.
2. The Dockerfile should be valid and all required files should be included in the build context.
3. The GitHub Container Registry should be properly configured for the repository.

### Manual Release Failed

If a manual release fails, check:

1. Do you have the necessary permissions?
2. Are you on the `main` branch?
3. Is your local repository up to date with the remote?
4. Are there any conflicts with the remote repository?
