# GitHub Actions Release Workflow Analysis

## 1. Summary of the Issue

A silent failure was observed in the release workflow where pushing a git tag in the format `v*.*.*` resulted in a successful workflow run but no GitHub Release was created. The investigation revealed that the root cause was a misunderstanding of the repository's automated release process, which is managed by `semantic-release`, not manual tagging.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

The core problem is a mismatch between the manual action of pushing a git tag and the repository's configured automated release process.

*   **Outdated Workflow Execution:** When a tag is pushed, GitHub Actions runs the workflow file as it existed at the commit the tag points to. In this case, it was an older, simpler version of the workflow that likely lacked the correct permissions, causing a silent failure.
*   **Current Workflow Trigger:** The current, correct `release.yml` workflow on the `main` branch is not triggered by tags. It is triggered by pushes to the `main` and `beta` branches.
*   **Automated Release Mechanism:** The repository uses `semantic-release` to automate the entire release lifecycle. This tool analyzes commit messages to determine the version number, generates a changelog, and then automatically creates both the git tag and the corresponding GitHub Release.
*   **Release Prevention Logic:** The current workflow contains a specific step to check if a release already exists for the latest commit. Pushing a tag manually causes this check to succeed, which then prevents the `semantic-release` step from running.

## 3. Recommended Solution

The solution is to align the development process with the automated tooling configured in the repository. Manual tagging for releases should be discontinued.

1.  **Adopt Conventional Commits:** All commits pushed to `main` or `beta` should follow the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). This is essential for `semantic-release` to function correctly.
    *   **`feat:`** for new features (results in a minor version bump).
    *   **`fix:`** for bug fixes (results in a patch version bump).
    *   **`BREAKING CHANGE:`** in the commit footer for changes that break backward compatibility (results in a major version bump).
2.  **Push to Release Branches:** All development work intended for a release should be merged and pushed to the `main` or `beta` branch.
3.  **Trust the Automation:** Once commits are pushed, the GitHub Actions workflow will trigger automatically and handle the entire release process.

No changes are required for the workflow code itself, as it is already correctly configured.

## 4. Preventative Measures

To prevent future confusion and ensure all team members understand the release process, the following is recommended:

*   **Update Documentation:** Add a "Release Process" section to the `README.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md` file. This section should clearly state:
    *   That the release process is fully automated using `semantic-release`.
    *   That developers **should not** create or push tags manually.
    *   That releases are generated by pushing commits with Conventional Commit messages to the `main` and `beta` branches.
*   **Clean Up Old Tags:** Consider deleting the manually created tags from the repository to avoid any potential confusion with the officially published releases.
