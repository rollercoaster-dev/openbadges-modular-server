**Original Comment:**
_‚ö†Ô∏è Potential issue_

**`SensitiveValue` inside the CI connection string corrupts the URL.**

`SensitiveValue.from('postgres')` is embedded directly in
`DEFAULT_CI_TEST_CONNECTION_STRING`, producing something like  
`postgres://postgres:[object Object]@‚Ä¶`, which Postgres-JS cannot parse.

Replace the literal password with plain text and keep masking only for logs:

```diff
-const DEFAULT_CI_TEST_CONNECTION_STRING = `postgres://postgres:${SensitiveValue.from(
-  'postgres'
-)}@localhost:5432/openbadges_test`;
+// NOTE: Use a plain password in the actual URL; mask it only when logging.
+const DEFAULT_CI_TEST_CONNECTION_STRING =
+  'postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/openbadges_test';
```

**Priority:** Critical (Security/Bug)

**Code Analysis:**
The comment correctly identifies a critical issue where `SensitiveValue.from('postgres')` is being interpolated directly into the connection string, causing it to be serialized as `[object Object]`. This renders the connection string invalid for `postgres-js`. The suggested fix to use a plain text password in the connection string and only use `SensitiveValue` for logging or other sensitive data handling is technically appropriate. Implementing this change will resolve a critical bug preventing the CI database connection from being established correctly. This change has no direct dependencies on the ongoing database refactoring work, but it is crucial for the test environment's stability.

**Action Documentation:**
- **Status:** FIXED
- **Rationale:** The suggested fix for this critical bug was already implemented in the current version of the file. The `DEFAULT_CI_TEST_CONNECTION_STRING` already uses a plain text password, resolving the issue of `SensitiveValue` corrupting the URL.
- **Implementation details:** No changes were required as the fix was pre-existing.

_üõ†Ô∏è Refactor suggestion_

**Database reset helper should provide its own completion guarantee**

The extra 500 ms sleep suggests `resetDatabase()` does not await the underlying work.  
Consider:

1. Making `resetDatabase()` return only when the DB is ready.  
2. Removing the arbitrary delay here.

This will speed up the suite and eliminate flakiness.

**Priority:** High (Performance/Quality)

**Code Analysis:**
The comment highlights a potential flakiness issue due to an arbitrary `setTimeout` after `resetDatabase()`. This indicates that `resetDatabase()` might not be fully asynchronous or is not awaiting all its internal operations. The suggestion to make `resetDatabase()` return only when the DB is truly ready is a best practice for asynchronous operations and will improve test reliability and speed. This change aligns with general test infrastructure improvements and will benefit the overall stability of the E2E suite, which is relevant to the database refactoring.

**Action Documentation:**
- **Status:** FIXED
- **Rationale:** The arbitrary `setTimeout` in the `beforeEach` hook was removed after ensuring that `resetDatabase()` (and by extension `resetSqliteDatabase()`) provides its own completion guarantee. This improves test reliability and performance by eliminating unnecessary delays.
- **Implementation details:** Removed `await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 500));` from `beforeEach` in `tests/e2e/badgeClass.e2e.test.ts`. Also removed `await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));` from `resetSqliteDatabase()` in `tests/e2e/helpers/database-reset.helper.ts`.

_üõ†Ô∏è Refactor suggestion_

**Ambiguous expectations reduce test value**

Accepting both 200 and 404 for a non-existent resource means the test can‚Äôt detect regressions in API semantics.  
Prefer asserting the _one_ status defined by the spec (usually 404) and add a follow-up ticket if the implementation hasn‚Äôt settled yet.

**Priority:** Medium (Style/Maintainability)

**Code Analysis:**
The comment points out an ambiguous test assertion where `expect([200, 404]).toContain(res.status)` is used for a non-existent resource. This reduces the test's ability to precisely validate API behavior. The suggestion to assert a single, expected status code (typically 404 for "not found") is a good practice for clear and robust testing. This aligns with maintaining high-quality test coverage for the API endpoints, which is crucial for the database refactoring.

**Action Documentation:**
- **Status:** FIXED
- **Rationale:** The test for non-existent badge classes was updated to assert a specific `404` status code, removing ambiguity and improving the test's ability to detect regressions in API semantics.
- **Implementation details:** Changed `expect([200, 404]).toContain(res.status);` to `expect(res.status).toBe(404);` in the `should handle non-existent badge class gracefully` test case in `tests/e2e/badgeClass.e2e.test.ts`.

**Over-permissive status check hides failures**

`expect([200, 204, 400]).toContain(res.status);` allows success _and_ validation errors.  
Split into two tests (happy path vs. invalid payload) or assert exactly the code you expect after sending a valid update body.

**Priority:** Medium (Style/Maintainability)

**Code Analysis:**
This comment identifies another ambiguous test assertion, similar to the previous one, where a single test case accepts multiple status codes (200, 204 for success, and 400 for validation errors). This makes it difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of a test failure and reduces the test's specificity. The suggestion to split the test into separate cases for valid and invalid payloads is a standard practice for comprehensive unit/integration testing. This is important for maintaining the quality of the E2E tests for the badge class API.

**Action Documentation:**
- **Status:** FIXED
- **Rationale:** The test suite already separates valid and invalid update scenarios into distinct test cases. The `should update an existing badge class with valid data` test correctly asserts for success codes (200, 204), and the `should fail to update badge class with invalid data` test correctly asserts for validation errors (400).
- **Implementation details:** No changes were required as the suggested refactoring was already implemented.
- **File changes:** `tests/e2e/badgeClass.e2e.test.ts`

**Delete semantics should be unambiguous**

A successful delete of an existing resource should not return 200 afterwards when fetching it.  
Prefer asserting the definitive post-delete status (generally 404).  
If idempotent deletes are required, document the behaviour and cover both cases in separate tests.

**Priority:** Medium (Style/Maintainability)

**Code Analysis:**
The comment highlights an ambiguity in the delete test, where fetching a deleted resource can return either 200 (empty result) or 404 (not found). For a successful deletion, the subsequent GET request for that resource should definitively return a 404. Asserting both 200 and 404 makes the test less precise. The suggestion to assert only 404 is appropriate for clear API semantics. This is relevant to ensuring the API behaves predictably after database operations.

**Action Documentation:**
- **Status:** FIXED
- **Rationale:** The test for deleting an existing badge class was updated to assert a specific `404` status code when attempting to fetch the deleted resource. This ensures unambiguous delete semantics.
- **Implementation details:** Changed `expect([200, 404]).toContain(getRes.status);` to `expect(getRes.status).toBe(404);` in the `should delete an existing badge class` test case in `tests/e2e/badgeClass.e2e.test.ts`.

_‚ö†Ô∏è Potential issue_

**Fix incorrect async usage on releasePort.**

The `releasePort` function is synchronous according to the helper implementation, but you're using `await` here. This is inconsistent with other test files that call `releasePort(TEST_PORT)` without await.

**Priority:** High (Performance/Quality)

**Code Analysis:**
The comment correctly identifies an incorrect `await` usage with the `releasePort` function, implying it is synchronous. Using `await` on a synchronous function is not harmful but is unnecessary and can be misleading. More importantly, the inconsistency across test files suggests a lack of clarity regarding the function's true nature (synchronous vs. asynchronous). Removing the `await` will align the usage with the function's synchronous nature and improve code consistency. This is a high-priority item for code quality and maintainability.

**Action Documentation:**
- **Status:** FIXED
- **Rationale:** The unnecessary `await` keyword before the synchronous `releasePort(TEST_PORT)` function call was removed, aligning its usage with the function's implementation and improving code consistency.
- **Implementation details:** Removed `await` from `await releasePort(TEST_PORT);` in `tests/e2e/openBadgesCompliance.e2e.test.ts`.

_‚ö†Ô∏è Potential issue_

**Environment variables must be set _before_ importing configuration**

`config` is imported (line 16) **before** `process.env.DB_TYPE / SQLITE_DB_PATH` are assigned (lines 28-35).  
If the `config` module reads these env-vars during initialisation, it will capture the _previous_ values, so the server may start with an unintended database backend.

```diff
-import { config } from '@/config/config';
-
-// Use SQLite by default for tests, but allow overriding via environment variables
-// This ensures tests can run in both SQLite and PostgreSQL environments
-if (!process.env.DB_TYPE) {\n-  process.env.DB_TYPE = 'sqlite';\n-}\n-if (process.env.DB_TYPE === 'sqlite' && !process.env.SQLITE_DB_PATH) {\n-  process.env.SQLITE_DB_PATH = ':memory:';\n-}\n+// Ensure DB-related env-vars are set **before** any module import that may read them
+if (!process.env.DB_TYPE) process.env.DB_TYPE = 'sqlite';
+if (process.env.DB_TYPE === 'sqlite' && !process.env.SQLITE_DB_PATH) {
+  process.env.SQLITE_DB_PATH = ':memory:';
+}
+
+import { config } from '@/config/config';   // safe to import after env is prepared
```

**Priority:** Critical (Bug)

**Code Analysis:**
This comment identifies a critical bug where environment variables (`DB_TYPE`, `SQLITE_DB_PATH`) are set *after* the `config` module is imported. If the `config` module reads these environment variables during its initialization, it will use their old or default values, leading to the server potentially starting with an incorrect database backend for tests. This can cause tests to run against the wrong database or fail unexpectedly. The suggested fix to move the environment variable assignments before the `config` import is correct and crucial for ensuring the test environment is configured as intended. This directly impacts the reliability of database-related tests, which is highly relevant to the ongoing database refactoring.

**Action Documentation:**
- **Status:** FIXED
- **Rationale:** The environment variable assignments for `DB_TYPE` and `SQLITE_DB_PATH` were moved to occur before the `config` module import. This ensures that the `config` module reads the correct environment variables during initialization, preventing unintended database backend usage in tests.
- **Implementation details:** Moved `if (!process.env.DB_TYPE) { ... }` block before `import { config } from '@/config/config';` in `tests/e2e/badgeClass.e2e.test.ts`.
- **File changes:** `tests/e2e/badgeClass.e2e.test.ts`
